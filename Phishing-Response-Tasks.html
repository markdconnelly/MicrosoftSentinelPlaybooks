<h2>Introduction</h2>
<dt>To report phishing messages, <a target='_blank' href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2167511">submit</a> them on Microsoft 365 Defender for analysis. Select "Should have been blocked" when prompted. Results are shown in the submissions detail flyout. Follow our <a target='_blank' href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2201181">step-by-step guide</a> for details.</dt>
<dt><b>This playbook for Security Operations (SecOps/SOC) teams will walk you through four stages of responding to a phishing incident: containment, investigation, remediation and prevention. The step-by-step instructions will help you take the required remedial action to protect information and minimize further risks.</b></dt>
<dt>Click on "Contain" task when you're ready to start.</dt>

<h2>Contain</h2>
<dt><b>� Which assets are involved?</b></dt>
<dd>� If an endpoint performed any suspicious activity, consider <a target='_blank' href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/respond-machine-alerts#isolate-devices-from-the-network">isolating the device</a> in M365D or <a target='_blank' href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/respond-threats-during-investigation">from Microsoft Sentinel</a>.</dd>
<dt><b>� Which user accounts are involved and what are their privileges?</b></dt>
<dd>� To assess the risk, first determine whether the user accounts are priority, management, or administrator accounts.</dd>
<dt><b>� What containments actions were already taken by automated response?</b></dt>
<dd>� What is the evidence remediation status?</dd>
<dd>� Check evidence & response tab in M365D portal for <a target='_blank' href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/air-review-approve-pending-completed-actions">pending approval actions</a>.</dd>

<h2>Investigate Mail</h2>
<dt><b>�	Review the initial phishing email.</b></dt>
<dd>�	From the incident in the M365D incidents queue, select the Evidence and Response tab.</dd>
<dd>�	Find the relevant email and open the email page. </dd>
<dd>�	Check the email header for the true source of the sender.</dd>
<dd>�	Investigate the source IP address of the email. Is the IP address used by attackers or campaigns?</dd>

<dt><b>�	Did the email contain a URL?</b></dt>
<dd>�	Go to the URL page to get the URL reputation.</dd>
<dt><b>�	Did the email contain an attachment?</b></dt>
<dd>�	Look for potential malicious content in the attachment, for example, PDF files, obfuscated PowerShell, or other script codes.</dd>
<dd>�	Check the device timeline to understand if the payload executed on the endpoint. If so, consider isolating the device. </dd>
<dt><b>�	Is there a risk that the user opened the email?</b></dt>
<dd>�	If yes, perform remediation.</dd>
<dt><b>�	Get the list of users who got the phishing email.</b><dt>

<h2>Investigate Involved Users</h2>
<dt>For each user that is involved in the incident:</dt>
<dt><b>�	Investigate the user account for suspicious actions.</b></dt>

<dt><b>�	What is the investigation priority score of the user account?</b></dt>
<dd>�	If the user performed suspicious activity, consider these steps:</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contact the user assigned the user account.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset the user account�s password.</dd>

<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Activity names:  'Add-MailboxPermission', 'Add-MailboxFolderPermission', 'Set-MailboxFolderPermission'</dd>
<dd>�	Is there a forwarding rule configured for the mailbox and was it added recently?</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Activity names: "New-InboxRule", "Set-InboxRule", "Set-Mailbox", "Set-TransportRule", "New-TransportRule".</dd>
<dt><b>�	If the email contained a malicious URL, did the user click the link in the email?</b></dt>
<dd>�	Get more details on the user click from the advanced hunting user clicks table</dd>
<dt><b>�	If the email contained an attachment, was the attachment payload executed? Was malicious code executed?</b></dt>
<dd>�	If yes, quarantine the file on the device, and consider to isolating the device.</dd>

<h2>Investigate Involved Devices</h2>
<dt>For each end user device that is involved in the incident:</dt>
<dt><b>�	Investigate the device for suspicious actions.</b></dt>

<h2>Remediate</h2>
<dt><b>�	Mark the incident as a True Positive.</b></dt>
<dt><b>�	Use Threat Explorer to remove the malicious emails from all of your inboxes and report the message as phishing to Microsoft.</b><dt>

<dd>�	URLs</dd>
<dd>�	Files</dd>

<h2>Prevent</h2>
<dt>If the phishing email was received because of a policy override, consider removing the override from the related allow list (Exchange Transport Rule/IP Allow List), and/or enabling ZAP.</dt>
<dt><b>�	Alerts generated due to policy overrides:</b></dt>
<dd>�	Phish delivered due to an ETR override.</dd>
<dd>�	Phish delivered due to an IP allow policy.</dd>
<dd>�	Phish not zapped because ZAP is disabled.</dd>
